The row selections are described in detail below.

The column selections are the same as the row selections except that Age is replaced with None.  None means no detail columns are displayed (i.e. only the Total, Moving In, and Deceased columns are displayed) and buildings are colored according to the number of citizens.

For most selections, this mod uses the game's calculation.

Residential buildings are colored according to the average of citizens residing in the building for the selected column and district.  The range of possible values for each column is shown in the tables below.  The low color corresponds to the building with the lowest average and the high color corresponds to the building with the highest average.  For example, if a city has 5 residential buildings with average education levels of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 1.3 and 1.9, then the building with 0.6 will have the low color, the building with 1.9 will have the high color, and the other 3 buildings will have a color proportionally in between 0.6 and 1.9.

[h3]Age[/h3]
The game maintains an internal age counter from 0 to 400 (not years).  Real age is computed by dividing the game's internal age counter by the game's conversion factor of 3.5.  This results in ages from 0 to 114.

In the base game, citizens die starting from about age 69 for poor health to 82 for full health.  Mods (e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027161563]Lifecycle Rebalance Revisited[/url]) can allow citizens to live longer.

[h3]Age Group[/h3]
The game computes Age Group as shown below from the game's internal age counter.  Mods (e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027161563]Lifecycle Rebalance Revisited[/url]) can change this logic.

[h3]Student[/h3]
The game computes Student level as shown below from the level of the school building the student attends.  Campus DLC buildings are level 3, so they count as University.
